# phop

Peer-to-peer state management for React using WebRTC. Share and sync state across browsers in real time — no backend required.

> ⚠️ **Early Development** — Core P2P features are under active development

## What is phop?

phop lets React apps share state directly between browsers using WebRTC data channels. A lightweight signaling server handles the initial handshake; after that, state flows peer-to-peer with no server in the middle.

```tsx
import { useSharedState } from 'phop';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useSharedState('count', 0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`phop`](packages/phop) | React library — `npm install phop` |
| [`signalling-server`](packages/signalling-server) | WebSocket server for coordinating WebRTC connections |
| `example` | Demo app showing two peers syncing state in real time |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.1.25+

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterddod/phop.git
cd phop
bun install
bun run dev
```

This starts three processes in parallel:

- **Example app** — http://localhost:9000
- **Signaling server** — ws://localhost:8080
- **Library** — watches `packages/phop/src` and rebuilds on changes

Open http://localhost:9000 to see two peer iframes syncing a shared counter in real time.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start everything in parallel |
| `bun run build` | Build all packages |
| `bun run build:lib` | Build phop library only |
| `bun run build:server` | Build signaling server only |
| `bun run lint` | Check for linting issues |
| `bun run check` | Lint and format all code |
